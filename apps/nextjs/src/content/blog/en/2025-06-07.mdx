title: I Tried to Teach an AI to Follow Rules. It Tried to Be Too Smart.

## It all started with a simple question

> *“Can we use artificial intelligence to classify regulatory events?”*

It sounded obvious.  
AI already writes texts, interprets complex documents, answers difficult questions…  
why wouldn’t it help classify an environmental or safety incident?

In practice, the answer was: **not the way I initially imagined**.

---

## The first attempt: “let the AI decide”

Like many people do today, I started with the most straightforward approach:

- send the event description,
- attach the applicable regulation,
- ask the AI to tell me the correct classification.

Sometimes it worked beautifully.  
Other times, it produced answers that *sounded* intelligent — but were simply wrong.

And worse:  
they were wrong **with confidence**.

---

## When “sounds right” is not enough

In one test, the event description said something like:

> *“There was a diesel oil spill that reached a water body.”*

For anyone working in the field, this is clearly an environmental accident.

The AI responded with something like:

> *“This is an operational incident with potential environmental impact.”*

Technically elegant.  
Regulatorily incorrect.

The regulation does not ask whether something *seems* like an incident.  
It asks:

- was there a spill?
- did it reach the environment?
- what was the volume?

There is no interpretation.  
There is **a rule**.

That was the moment everything clicked.

---

## The problem wasn’t the AI. It was the role I gave it.

The AI was doing exactly what it was trained to do:

- interpret text,
- infer meaning,
- choose the most likely answer.

The problem is that **regulation does not work on probability**.

It works like a rigid checklist:

> if X happened, then Y applies.

It doesn’t matter if it feels excessive.  
It doesn’t matter if it was small.  
It doesn’t matter if “most cases” would be different.

---

## The analogy that changed everything

Imagine a GPS that, instead of following traffic rules, decided to “interpret the context”:

> “This red light seems optional.”  
> “People usually don’t stop here.”  
> “The risk of an accident is low.”

That would be a disaster.

And that was exactly how I was trying to use AI —  
as an opinionated GPS in an environment that requires **absolute traffic lights**.

---

## The turning point: what if the AI decided nothing?

Instead of asking:

> *“What is the correct classification?”*

I started asking:

> *“Is this condition met?”*

The regulation became a **decision tree**, not a block of text.

Questions like:

- was there environmental impact?
- was the product hazardous?
- did the volume exceed a threshold?

The AI does not choose the path.  
It only answers each question **one at a time**.

Like a technical assistant reading the report out loud,  
while the rule itself decides where to go next.

---

## The result was almost anticlimactic — and that was a good thing

Suddenly:

- errors became predictable,
- decisions became explainable,
- and when something went wrong… it was clear *why*.

The AI stopped being a mysterious oracle  
and became a highly disciplined operator.

It doesn’t *guess*.  
It **checks**.

---

## What I learned from this

The biggest trap when using AI in critical decisions is wanting it to be too intelligent.

In regulated environments, intelligence is not creativity.  
It is **consistency**.

AI works best when it:

- interprets messy human language,
- extracts evidence,
- and respects clear boundaries defined by humans.

---

## The conclusion that stuck

After all this, I ended up with a sentence that now guides the entire project:

> **AI should not decide the rule.  
It should help apply it.**

When we do that, AI stops being a risk —  
and becomes a powerful ally.

👉 **In the next article**, the story gets even more interesting:  
the day I realized that **not every ambiguity is an AI failure** —  
sometimes, reality itself is ambiguous.
