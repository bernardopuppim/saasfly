## The day I realized the system was “working” — even when it stopped

At some point in the project, something strange started happening.

The system would run.
The AI would evaluate the event.
And then… it would stop.

No answer.
No classification.
No final label.

Just a message that basically said:

> *“I’m not sure. A human needs to decide.”*

My first reaction was frustration.

> *“Great. It broke.”*

But it hadn’t.

It was doing exactly what it was supposed to do.

## The uncomfortable truth about real incidents

In theory, regulations look clean.

They’re written as if reality were always precise:
- clear volumes,
- clear impacts,
- clear responsibilities.

In practice?

Incident descriptions look like this:

> “There may have been a small leak.”  
> “It’s not clear if the product reached the environment.”  
> “The volume is estimated, but not confirmed.”  

This is not an edge case.

This is **most cases**.

## The mistake I almost made: forcing certainty

At first, I tried to “solve” this.

I thought:
- maybe the prompt isn’t good enough,
- maybe the model needs more context,
- maybe RAG will clarify things.

So I added more:
- more documents,
- more embeddings,
- more reasoning.

The answers got longer.
They sounded smarter.

They were still guessing.

And guessing, in this context, is dangerous.

---

## The key insight: ambiguity is a signal, not a failure

Then I noticed a pattern.

Whenever the model hesitated, the **entropy** was high.
Multiple paths looked plausible.
None clearly dominated.

That wasn’t noise.

That was the system telling me something important:

> *“The information provided is insufficient to make a safe decision.”*

That’s not an AI problem.
That’s a **process problem**.

## Enter Human-in-the-Loop (HITL) — but not as a patch

Most systems treat HITL like a fallback:

> “If the AI fails, ask a human.”

That framing is wrong.

In this project, HITL became a **first-class design element**.

The AI does not escalate because it is weak.
It escalates because **some decisions are inherently human**.

Especially when:
- the cost of being wrong is high,
- the information is incomplete,
- accountability matters.

## The moment everything changed

I remember one specific test.

The system reached a node asking about environmental impact volume.
Two branches were possible.
Both had reasonable arguments.

Instead of picking one, the system paused and said:

> “Here are the options.  
> Here’s why each one could apply.  
> You decide.”

That was the moment I realized:

This wasn’t automation.
This was **augmented decision-making**.

---

## Why this is better than full automation

Letting AI decide everything feels efficient.
Until you have to explain the decision.

With HITL:
- the human owns the final call,
- the AI documents the reasoning,
- and the system records *why* that path was chosen.

No black box.
No silent assumptions.
No post-incident surprises.

---

## A subtle but powerful shift in responsibility

Something interesting happens when you design systems this way.

People stop asking:
> “What did the AI decide?”

And start asking:
> “What information did the AI surface for the decision?”

That’s a much healthier question.

---

## The lesson I didn’t expect to learn

I went into this project trying to reduce human involvement.

I came out realizing that the real goal was different:

> **Reduce human uncertainty, not human presence.**

AI isn’t here to replace judgment.
It’s here to **support it — honestly**.

---

## Final thought

If your AI system never asks for help,
it’s probably overconfident.

And overconfidence is the most dangerous bug of all.

👉 **In the next article**, I’ll tell the story of how  
**letting the AI explore more than one path — briefly —  
actually made the final decision stronger, not weaker.**
