## The real fear: “this is going to become a computational monster”

At some point in the project, one thing became clear:

> **If we let the AI explore too many paths, this won’t scale.**

Keeping multiple hypotheses alive made sense conceptually.  
But in practice, a very real fear emerged:

- trees growing uncontrollably  
- long execution times  
- confusing decisions  
- exploding computational costs  

It was the classic dilemma:

> **either you explore deeply, or you run fast.**

Having both felt impossible.

---

## The turning point: thinking like an experienced investigator

That’s when a simple — almost obvious — question appeared:

> *Does a good investigator analyze every possible hypothesis until the end?*

Of course not.

They discard hypotheses constantly.

Not by intuition,  
but by **lack of evidence**.

That insight became the technical core of the system:

> **information-driven pruning.**

## Entropy: when uncertainty is real (and when it isn’t)

Not every uncertainty deserves human attention.

Some uncertainty is just noise.

Entropy entered the system as an honest measure of doubt:

- Low entropy → the model is confident  
- High entropy → multiple answers are competing  

But the most important insight was this:

> **entropy only makes sense *after* pruning.**

---

## The classic mistake we almost made

Early on, the system treated all children equally.

Even those with:
- score = 0  
- clearly incoherent justifications  
- explicit contradictions with the event text  

The result?

- artificially high entropy  
- unnecessary HITL triggers  
- poor decisions disguised as “uncertainty”  

The doubt wasn’t real.  
It was **manufactured**.

---

## The rule that changed everything: score zero doesn’t get a voice

The fix was simple — and powerful:

> **Children with score == 0 do not participate in entropy.  
> They do not participate in HITL.  
> They do not participate in decisions.**

They are pruned.

No drama.

No debate.

## The immediate impact of pruning

As soon as pruning was applied:

- entropy collapsed  
- HITL stopped triggering unnecessarily  
- the correct paths naturally emerged  

The system started behaving like an experienced specialist:

> *“This clearly makes no sense. Ignore it.”*

---

## HITL stopped being a crutch and became an exception

Before, humans were called because the system was confused.

After pruning, humans were called only when:

- two **truly plausible** hypotheses competed  
- the event description was genuinely ambiguous  
- objective information was missing  

In other words:

> **HITL became governance, not correction.**

---

## Knowing when to stop thinking is intelligence

Perhaps the most counterintuitive insight of the project was this:

> **A smart AI knows when to stop thinking.**

Exploring everything is not intelligence.  
It’s brute force.

What we built instead was a system that:
- explores less  
- discards faster  
- decides at the right moment  

---

## A system that respects time and risk

This combination of:
- score-based pruning  
- clean entropy  
- limited exploration  

created something rare:

> **a system that is explainable, fast, and reliable at the same time.**

Nothing was guessed.  
Nothing was over-analyzed.

---

## Conclusion: fewer paths, more truth

In the end, pruning wasn’t just an optimization.

It was a philosophical decision.

It told the system:

> *“You don’t need to consider everything.  
> You need to consider what makes sense.”*

And interestingly enough, that’s exactly how good professionals make decisions in the real world.

**why RAG shouldn’t run all the time — and how turning it off made the system both faster and more accurate.**
