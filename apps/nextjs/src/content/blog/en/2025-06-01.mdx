## The myth of full automation

For a long time, the goal seemed obvious:

> **Build a fully automated system, with no human intervention.**

Humans were seen as:
- a model failure  
- a technical limitation  
- something to eliminate in the future  

Human-in-the-Loop (HITL) was treated as a **Plan B**.

Reality told a different story.

---

## The real problem was not lack of intelligence

Most of the time, the system made correct decisions.

Problems appeared when:
- information was incomplete  
- the event was ambiguous  
- multiple interpretations were plausible  
- the decision had high regulatory impact  

In those moments, the failure wasn’t technical.

It was **epistemic**.

---

## Ambiguity is not a bug — it’s a property of the real world

Real-world events don’t arrive neatly structured.
They come as:
- vague text  
- incomplete descriptions  
- imprecise terminology  
- internal contradictions  

Forcing the model to *always* decide creates two risks:
- **overconfidence** (wrong decision with high certainty)  
- **epistemic silence** (weak or artificial explanations)  

That’s when HITL changed its role.

---

## The shift: using entropy as a signal, not an error

Instead of triggering humans:
- when the model failed  

we started triggering them:
- when **decision entropy was high**  

Meaning:
- several options were plausible  
- the model itself was uncertain  

Humans entered **before the error**, not after.

---

## Humans as ambiguity resolvers, not judges

This distinction mattered.

HITL is not meant to:
- correct the model  
- review everything  
- replace AI  

It exists to:
- **resolve contextual ambiguity**  
- provide a grounded choice  
- anchor high-impact decisions  

Humans do what machines cannot:
interpret intent, context, and consequence.

---

## The system still owns the decision

One critical detail:
the human **does not break the flow**.

After a human choice:
- LATS continues  
- the path is resumed  
- the final decision is computed  
- probability logs are preserved  

The system **incorporates** the human decision.
It does not override itself.

---

## Governance, not manual correction

At this point, it became clear:

> **HITL is not manual correction.  
> It is algorithmic governance.**

It provides:
- documented sensitive decisions  
- traceability  
- reduced regulatory risk  
- increased trust in the system  

Especially in domains like:
- safety  
- environment  
- compliance  
- auditing  

---

## An unexpected benefit: structural learning

Each human interaction produces:
- decision data  
- justifications  
- ambiguity patterns  

This allows the system to:
- refine the tree  
- reduce future entropy  
- improve pruning criteria  
- evolve in a guided way  

Humans are not a bottleneck.
They are a **learning signal**.

---

## The classic mistake: trying to remove humans

Many systems fail because they try to:
> *“solve everything with bigger models.”*

Maturity comes from recognizing:
- where AI excels  
- where humans are irreplaceable  

Strong systems don’t choose one over the other.
They **combine both**.

---

## Conclusion: distributed intelligence

In the end, the architecture became more honest.

The machine:
- classifies  
- computes  
- explores possibilities  

The human:
- resolves ambiguity  
- assumes responsibility  
- anchors critical decisions
