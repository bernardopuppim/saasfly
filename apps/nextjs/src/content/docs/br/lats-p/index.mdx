# LoopynLATS

**LoopynLATS** is a probabilistic decision tree engine designed to navigate complex investigations with **explicit uncertainty handling** and **Human-in-the-Loop (HITL) governance**.

Instead of forcing deterministic decisions, LoopynLATS measures confidence at every step, escalates ambiguity when needed, and produces **fully auditable decision paths**.

---

## Why LoopynLATS?

Traditional decision trees assume certainty. Real-world investigations rarely have it.

LoopynLATS was built to answer a different question:

> *“How confident are we in this decision — and what should happen if we are not?”*

By combining probabilistic reasoning, entropy-based uncertainty detection, and optional human review, LoopynLATS enables systems that are:

* Safer
* More transparent
* Easier to audit
* Better aligned with real operational risk

---

## Core Concepts

At its core, LoopynLATS is built around a few key ideas:

* **Probabilistic navigation**: every decision is treated as a probability distribution, not a hard rule
* **Entropy as a signal**: uncertainty is measured explicitly, not inferred implicitly
* **Human-in-the-Loop**: ambiguity triggers human review by design, not by exception
* **Stateful investigations**: every step is tracked, serializable, and replayable

These concepts allow LoopynLATS to scale from simple classification tasks to complex, high-risk investigations.

---

## How It Works (High Level)

1. An investigation starts with an event description
2. Available options are evaluated and scored
3. Scores are converted into probabilities
4. Entropy is calculated to measure uncertainty
5. The system either:

   * Proceeds automatically, or
   * Requests human input (HITL)
6. The process repeats until a terminal classification is reached

Every step is recorded. Nothing is hidden.

---

## What LoopynLATS Is (and Is Not)

### It *is*

* A decision **navigation** engine
* A framework for uncertainty-aware workflows
* A foundation for audit-friendly systems
* A bridge between automation and human judgment

### It is *not*

* A black-box classifier
* A generic rules engine
* A replacement for domain expertise
* An autonomous decision-maker without oversight

---

## Typical Use Cases

LoopynLATS is well-suited for domains where:

* Decisions must be explainable
* Uncertainty must be explicit
* Human oversight is required
* Auditability is non-negotiable

Examples include:

* Incident investigation and classification
* Compliance and risk assessment
* Safety analysis
* Operational decision support

## Getting Started

If you are new to LoopynLATS, we recommend the following path:

1. **Glossary** — establish the shared vocabulary
2. **How LATS-P Works** — understand the algorithm
3. **Configuring LATS-P** — tune behavior and governance
4. **Designing Good Decision Trees** — avoid structural pitfalls
5. **Evaluators Deep Dive** — choose the right evaluation strategy
6. **HITL Integration Guide** — integrate human review
7. **API Reference** — implement with confidence

---

## Design Philosophy

LoopynLATS is built on a simple principle:

> *Uncertainty should be measured, not hidden.*

Rather than pretending every decision is clear, the system exposes ambiguity and lets you decide how to handle it.
